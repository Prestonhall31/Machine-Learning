# Conclusion

## Project Overview
The goal of this project was to develop a supervised machine learning algorithm capable of identifying persons of interest (POIs) in the Enron scandal dataset. This dataset contains financial information and email data of former Enron employees. The Enron scandal, characterized by fraudulent activities leading to the company's bankruptcy in 2001, served as a compelling case for machine learning analysis.

## Feature Selection and Engineering
We carefully selected features that we believed would be indicative of whether an employee was a POI or not. In addition to using existing features, we engineered two new features:

1. **from_poi_with_shared_receipt_percentage:** This feature aimed to capture the relationship between shared receipts with POIs and emails from POIs. It was created to explore potential correlations between these variables.

2. **total_compensation:** We created this feature to provide a comprehensive view of an employee's compensation. It combined 'total_payments' and 'total_stock_value' to better represent an employee's overall compensation.

Feature selection was crucial in our analysis, with 'from_poi_with_shared_receipt_percentage' proving to be particularly valuable based on SelectKBest results.

## Algorithm Selection
We experimented with various machine learning algorithms, including Gaussian Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, AdaBoost, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. Each algorithm exhibited varying levels of performance. However, the Support Vector Machine algorithm stood out as the best performer with an accuracy of 91%. The choice of algorithm significantly influenced the model's ability to classify POIs accurately.

## Parameter Tuning
For the Support Vector Machine, parameter tuning was conducted by adjusting the C parameter. This fine-tuning process allowed us to optimize the algorithm's performance, leading to improved accuracy and precision.

## Validation
Validation played a crucial role in our analysis. We employed K-fold cross-validation to assess the model's performance, ensuring that it would not overfit to the test set. Proper validation helps in creating a model that generalizes well to unseen data, increasing its real-world applicability.

## Evaluation Metrics
We used three key evaluation metrics—accuracy, precision, and recall—to assess the model's performance. These metrics provide a comprehensive view of the algorithm's effectiveness. While accuracy measures overall correctness, precision and recall offer insights into the algorithm's ability to correctly identify POIs without producing too many false positives.

In summary, through rigorous experimentation, feature engineering, and algorithm selection, we achieved notable results in classifying Enron employees as POIs. The Support Vector Machine algorithm, when properly tuned, demonstrated the highest accuracy of 91%, with a precision of 67%. This means that our model correctly identified 67% of the individuals classified as POIs, with an overall accuracy of 91%. However, recall remained at 40%, indicating that there is still room for improvement in identifying all actual POIs.

This project underscores the power of machine learning in uncovering insights from complex datasets and its potential to aid in fraud detection and prevention in real-world scenarios. Further refinements and exploration of features, algorithms, and parameter tuning could enhance the model's performance, ultimately contributing to more effective fraud detection systems in financial domains.
